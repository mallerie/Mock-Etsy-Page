This usually takes 1-2 business days. 1st class standard delivery is not tracked but recorded & signed for delivery is available as an option at checkout. Next day delivery is available as an option at the checkout at an extra cost, but this guarantees delivery by 1pm the next working day and comes with tracking. \r\n\r\nTO EUROPE -\r\nItems to Europe are sent via Royal Mail Airmail  International Standard. The service usually takes around 5-7 working days but it can take longer depending on how quickly the service is running, bank holidays etc. No tracking number available is available with the standard option but order tracking can be chosen at the checkout for an extra cost. \r\n\r\nTO AMERICA AND ELSEWHERE -\r\nItems are sent via Royal Mail Airmail International Standard.

If the print itself is damaged, a picture would be great so I can see where the postal system failed. Replacements can of course be sent out as soon as possible, or refunds if necessary. \r\n\r\nDELIVERY TIMES\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t be held responsible for the time taken for something to be delivered internationally, once dispatched it is at the mercy of the postal service! please see our delivery policy for more details on expected delivery times. \r\n\r\nITEM NOT RECIEVED \r\n\r\nIn the event of an item getting lost in the mail our first port of call will always be to get the item sent out again as quickly as possible.
